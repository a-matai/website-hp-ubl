**Hi, I'm Anant Matai.** I'm not sure what I'm usually doing but I seem to keep busy enough.

In my waking hours, you can find me reading up on some random thing, working through my sociological and computer science interests, tokenizing finance, or just spending time with the people in my life. In the short-term, I'm interested in better understanding things. My long-term goal is to become fluent at interacting with large, complex social systems through a variety of research methods. 


tl,dr:
_I want to study things I find interesting and hopefully find some relation between them._
