**Hi, I'm Anant Matai.** I'm not sure what I'm usually doing but I seem to keep busy enough. In my spare time I enjoy making coffee, food, watching all sorts of TV and films, and walking around the city I'm occupying at the moment (a little harder right now). 

In my waking hours, you can find me reading up on some random thing (I will start a blog soon), taking Sociology and CS classes, trying to do some research (currently working on Climate Science), or just spending time with people. In the short-term, I'm interested in better understanding things. My long-term goal is to become fluent at understanding and interacting with large complex social systems through mixed-methods research and ethnography. 


tl,dr:
_I want to study things I find interesting and hopefully find some relation between them._
