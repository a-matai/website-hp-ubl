Hi, I'm Anant and this is my little-corner-of-the-internet. I am currently up to the following things:
- working on [this website](https://amatai.me),
- starting a blog (_wait for link_),
- working at [RDCEP](https://rdcep.org/) on Research and Data Visualization,
- serving as a TA, Mentor Liasion, and Board Member of [campusCatalyst](https://www.campuscatalyst.uchicago.edu/),
- finishing my BS in Mathematics and Computer Science,
- watching ALL the great comedy TV shows
- a few other things here and there.

Feel free to [get in touch](/about/) for any (or no) reason, I'd love to chat.
